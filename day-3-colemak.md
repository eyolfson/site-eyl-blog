title: Day 3 Colemak

Well, I'm typing this in Colemak, which is something. In day 1 I just learned
the keyboard layout and maxed at about 10 WPM.  Day 2 I moved to typeracer and
maxed at 16 WPM. Today when I woke up I hit 21 WPM. I can start to feel my
muscle memory developing for some common words, but it's spotty at best. The S
key in particular really throws me off. Overall it seems like common words are
too easy to type and should be harder, damn you QWERTY.
