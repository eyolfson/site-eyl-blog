title: Initial Post

It's about time I actually had a place to easily write posts. I took some time
today to quickly set up a Django app that would parse and publish Markdown files
I pushed to a Git repository. It's basic but it seems to work, as long as this
post gets published.

I found the implementation straight forward with the aid of my
[Django Gitolite](https://github.com/eyolfson/django-gitolite) to write in Git
hooks. I attempt to open source my work and this is no different. The
implementation for the blog, along with the rest of the site, is on
[Github](https://github.com/eyolfson/site-eyl). The blog code specifically is in
the `django_blog` module. The blog posts are also available on
[Github](https://github.com/eyolfson/site-eyl-blog).
