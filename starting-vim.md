title: Starting Vim

Previously I've been using Emacs with Evil to emulate Vim keybindings. I liked
the idea of the keybindings but found myself going back to Emacs mode instead
of learning Vim keybindings. I wasn't completely happy with some other things
in Emacs. For instance, a minor thing is there seemed to be 4 different ways to
change the font face. Some ways worked in daemon mode, some not; some made the
window resize oddly and left strange unusable areas. I decided why not try out
Vim itself.

I downloaded Vim and the following plugins: `fugitive`, `nerdtree`, `surround`,
`colors-solarized`, and `ultisnips`. There's a more extensive list of plugins
on [Vim Awesome](http://vimawesome.com/) which I'll have to check out as well.
So far I'm liking Vim (still need to tweak a few things though). In the few
days I've used it I found text objects, and they're awesome. Using `ci(` to
delete everything inside the brackets surrounding the cursor and enter insert
mode is pure bliss.
